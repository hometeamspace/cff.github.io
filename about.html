                            <p>-	Our Organization then stepped into the third year of dedicated operations, as mentioned above, and got the valuable opportunity to associate ourselves with Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Howrah, West Bengal, India. By this time, we gained more experience and also came in contact with many more patients suffering from Cancer who heard about the devoted activities of our Organization, through various sources. In 2020, we received the CSR Certificate no. CSR 00009535 and exemptions under Section 80G of Income Tax Act for receiving tax free donations. After outbreak of the Covid19 Pandemic in March'2020, we supported some patients with their regular Stoma accessories and subsequently offered regular mental health counselling to both the patients and their families. During this crucial time we lost many patients too. With the permission of Police Authorities, we supported approximately 200 cancer patients and their families with dry ration, food supplements, hygiene products, chemotherapy drugs etc by delivering to the homes of many patients. While working in the Hospitals continuously for so many years, we found that the Ward Boys and Nurses need proper guidance of correctly fixing various Stoma accessories to the patients during their stay in the Hospital. So, we started organising Stoma Nurses Training once a month at all the 3 Hospitals. </p>

                            <p>CANCER FIGHT FOUNDATION, a Registered Trust was founded in 2015 and within two years we received 12A Registration Certificate from "Income Tax Department", ''Government of India''. We started our humble journey at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (Operated by Government of India), Kolkata. While supporting the Cancer patients at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India, we also got an opportunity to work simultaneously with Saroj Gupta Cancer and Research Institute, Kolkata, West Bengal, India and to support the Colon Cancer patients for Urostomy, Colostomy and Ileostomy treatments, who have been struggling with their temporary or permanent Stoma bags </p>

Cancer Fight Foundation (CFF) started its dedicated journey in the year 2015 activating our first project with patients suffering from Colorectal Cancer, who required Stoma Bags. As part of our team, we were fortunate enough to have an experienced Cancer Survivor who had fought and beaten Colorectal Cancer and now is eager to help others, suffering from the same disease. </p>

                        <p>Our determination and concerted efforts were aimed to forge ahead to take care of the child patients from below poverty level families, suffering from critical disease of Leukaemia (Blood Cancer). The treatment of this disease is not only time consuming, it's very expensive as well. In addition, lack of adequate infrastructure at remote locations all over the State of West Bengal, which is our jurisdiction at present, add to their helplessness..</p>

                        <p>Our second project was with the Child patients of the Paediatric Ward at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, who are suffering from the dreadful disease Leukaemia (Blood Cancer). They needed various food supplements such as Horlicks, Complan, Padiasure etc for 365 days.</p>

Under her mentorship, the CFF journey started at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI), Hazra, Kolkata. Simultaneously she drove CFF to start supporting the patients with Saroj Gupta Cancer Hospital, Thakurpukur & Narayana Superspeciality Hospital,  Howrah. She also emphasizes on providing psychological and emotional support to the patients as they undergo their treatment. Her relentless endeavors continued in the testing times of Covid where the patients / family were provided with essential support. She states the fact that treatment of Cancer is very expensive and CFF has its arms open to esteemed organizations & kind hearted individuals to extend their helping hands so that CFF can thrive and strive to move forward in seeing many smiling patients and survivors, who largely depend on the support provided.  She wants to fulfill her noble purpose in life, with a lot of compassion, courage and limitless strength creating many new projects on rehabilitation of child and adult Survivors and also on Palliative Care - which is dignity at the end.</p>

                                <p class="text-secondary">After cardiovascular disease cancer is the second biggest cause of human deaths worldwide. There is an ever increasing trend in the incidence of cancer globally. There is no refuting it. The moment anyone comes across the word ‘cancer” they develop a strong feeling of fear and anxiety because of which they start avoiding anything and everything related to cancer. As a result there is big gap in the awareness and disease management of cancer.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-secondary">In today’s material world apart from struggling for a pseudo success and happiness how many of us really think of others and when it happens to be Patients? It is indeed a very big gesture of being Human in practicing and spreading humanity and kindness in this present material centric environment. Susmita Banerjee, the founder of Cancer Fight Foundation (CFF) did carve this gesture through CFF in extending all forms of support to bring back the smile and happiness among the cancer patients and the survivors irrespective of their old-middle-young age. Cancer Fight Foundation (CFF) since inception is doing a stupendous job in cancer patient care under her leadership. The journey of CFF with the stoma patients to the child patients at the Paediatric ward of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) has marked significance in cancer care. To endorse and empower in rendering patient care services CFF got registered under West Bengal trust Act 1880 and even got associated with Cancer Care Indian (CACI).</p>

                                <p class="text-secondary">Cancer Control is an area in which we need participation from all sectors of the society. There are areas in which various individuals or agencies can put in their contributions. In parlance I too got associated and feel privileged to be a part of CFF. Since I am associated with the academic sector I would like to contribute CFF in terms of awareness programs among the college going students to become the Change Agents. These young generations can bring in wonders as Change Agents if well tutored and trained in fundamental aspects of Cancer Patient care and Awareness. </p>

                                <p class="text-secondary">The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and other agencies are supporting fellowships and we Indian can utilize these opportunities to get the much needed human resource for the country. At the same time the results achieved in India should be widely propagated through the International Agencies, to help other countries and to get further support from various agencies across the globe.</p>

                                <p>Cancer Fight Foundation(CFF) is a non-profit organization based in Kolkata, India and its true north lies in helping the poverty-ridden in their treatment and rehabilitation from Cancer. I have observed that all donor’s donations to the CFF, gets judiciously spent on cancer survivors/ailing patients, for their well-being, care, sustenance, or else for administrative costs necessary to run a non-profit. No donations are spent otherwise or by CFF members/volunteers for personal gains. Going forward I wish CFF explores further its immense potential to touch more lives at a much broader & bigger scale and have adequate human resources & funding secured to support its mission into the future. Cheers! </p>
